# rpg_character_sheet_manager_enhanced
RPG Character Sheet Enhanced Project

This project is intended to replace available RPG character sheet managers of both open-source and proprietary RPG system managers by offering improved functionality and modifiability at no cost to users as an unrestricted open-source project. This program is going to be free to the public and serves to enhance everyone's RPG experience by automating "mechanical crunch time" so players can focus on roleplaying rather than on performing calculations by hand. In addition, this program will be customizable via an API and allow players to implement any RPG system of their choosing.
